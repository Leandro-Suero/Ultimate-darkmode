# The ULTIMATE Dark Mode

    This is an experiment for different ways to activate dark mode.
    In order of relevance/final impact those are:

## 1- Local Storage
    When the user does an active selection of a theme with the buttons, it is persisted and used as the default setting for next website visit.

## 2- OS theme
    If there isn't a previous setting stored then it checks for the OS dark theme option to see if it is enabled.

## 3- Time of the day
    If there are no settings to default to, then it sets the dark mode when it is night time (21hs-7hs).
